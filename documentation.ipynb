    "The main goal of this project is to create a flash card tool specifically designed to assist in the acquisition of knowledge on different subjects. The application provides users with a range of features, such as the creation, storage, and management of learning cards. Furthermore, it seeks to enhance comprehension of the educational material through gamification, as the application also has a scoring system to monitor user progress. \n",

While this process helped us align our expectations and work out a comprehensive requirements list, we quickly realised that in order to make progress, we need to start prototyping at a very early stage. \n",

    "### General assumptions and specifications\n",
    "* Keep it simple and the scope small to make sure we get the project done.\n",
    "* It's ok if not all our ideas are built into the program yet.\n",
    "* Deliver a command line tool. (This expectation changed in the last session.)\n",
    "* The MVP of the app will be used by a single user.\n",
    "* We need a way to save sets and cards.\n",
    "* We want some kind of scoring.\n",
    "* We want to randomize the cards.\n",

    "### Early decisions \n",
    "* Work with GitHub\n",
    "* Modularize, *.py files\n",
