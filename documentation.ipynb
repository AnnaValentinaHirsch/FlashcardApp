    "Our objective for this project was to develop a Flash Card Tool designed to aid in learning various topics. The program should enable users to create, save, and manage their card sets and individual cards. Additionally, it should support users in studying the content of the cards. The tool should incorporate a scoring system to track user success and employ randomization to enhance the learning process.\n",

    "We started out by visualizing and thinking through the functionality of the application. While this process helped to align our expectations and determine the requirements for the app, we expereinced that talking and visualizing would only bring us thus far. In order to make progress we had to start coding.\n",

    "* Keep it simple and the scope small to make sure we get the project done.\n",
    "* It's ok if not all our ideas are built into the program yet.\n",
    "* Deliver a command line tool. (This expectation changed in the last session.)\n",
    "* The MVP of the app will be used by a single user.\n",
    "* We need a way to save sets and cards.\n",
